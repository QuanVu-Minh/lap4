<h3>(WIS) Service Information Wireless own yourProgramming</h3> 
<p>5 February 2005</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Sending and receiving text messages had become part of our daily activities. Can you image yourselves without a
  mobile phone for a day? Would you leave home without it? And would you be wondering how those mobile
  applications are written, were you can send a text message to a specified number, and you get the necessary information
  needed in a form of a reply or simply registering your name for a contest?</p> <br>
<p>This article discusses the things you need to know in order to program your own wireless information service. In
  validating the concept, a sample program was created using Sun Microsystems's Java[tm] 2 Standard Edition
  (J2SE[tm]) and Java Communication API. The application developed had been tested on a PC equipped with an
  infrared dongle that connects to an infrared enabled phone, in this case a Nokia 8310. The application is divided into
  two parts, the messaging library and the information service application.</p>
<h3>Message SMS theUnderstanding</h3>
<p>Before developing the application, let us take a look at how a message is handled by the mobile phone. A Short
  Messaging Service or SMS text can be up to 160 characters long. Each character of the message is represented using 7
  bits instead of 8. 8-bit messages with a maximum of 140 characters are usually not viewable as text messages. This is
  normally used for ringtones and images. For Unicode (UCS2) text messages, which are used for Asian languages are
  16-bit messages. This type of messages has a maximum length of 70 characters. Blinking SMS is also represented as a
  16-bit message otherwise known as Flash SMS.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the SMS
  system library, various database:
  inquiry system can be
  developed. This can be a
  dictionary, horoscope, or
  registration system. The
  possibilities are endless.</p>
